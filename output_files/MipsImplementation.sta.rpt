Info: Running Quartus Prime Timing Analyzer
    Info: Version 22.1std.2 Build 922 07/20/2023 SC Lite Edition
    Info: Processing started: Sat Dec 16 21:28:40 2023
Info: Command: quartus_sta MipsImplementation -c MipsImplementation
Info: qsta_default_script.tcl version: #1
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Info (20030): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 2 of the 2 processors detected
Info (334003): Started post-fitting delay annotation
Info (334004): Delay annotation completed successfully
Warning (332046): Timing netlist is empty. No timing reports will be generated.
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'MipsImplementation.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info: Found TIMING_ANALYZER_REPORT_SCRIPT_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ANALYSIS = ON
Info: Can't run Report Timing Closure Recommendations. The current device family is not supported.
Info: Quartus Prime Timing Analyzer was successful. 0 errors, 3 warnings
    Info: Peak virtual memory: 313 megabytes
    Info: Processing ended: Sat Dec 16 21:28:41 2023
    Info: Elapsed time: 00:00:01
    Info: Total CPU time (on all processors): 00:00:00
